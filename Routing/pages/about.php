        <p>DNA molecules do two important things. Firstly they replicate, that is to
            say they make copies of themselves. This has gone on nonstop ever since
            the beginning of life, and the DNA molecules are now very good at it
            indeed. As an adult, you consist of a thousand million million cells, but
            when you were first conceived you were just a single cell, endowed with
            one master copy of the architect's plans. This cell divided into two, and
            each of the two cells received its own copy of the plans. Successive
            divisions took the number of cells up to 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on into the
            billions. At every division the DNA plans were faithfully copied, with
            scarcely any mistakes.</p>
