    <p>When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney
        declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous
        criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. "He will kill,"
        said the Commissioner, "at the drop of a feather."
        But how did "Two Gun" Crowley regard himself? We know, because
        while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter
        addressed "To whom it may concern, " And, as he wrote, the blood
        flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this
        letter Crowley said: "Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one
        - one that would do nobody any harm."<br>
        A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party
        with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a
        policeman walked up to the car and said: "Let me see your license."
        Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman
        down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped
        out of the car, grabbed the officer's revolver, and fired another bullet
        into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said: "Under my
        coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody
        any harm.'</p>
