        <p>Keeping a commitment or a promise is a major deposit; breaking one is a major
            withdrawal. In fact, there's probably not a more massive withdrawal than to make a
            promise that's important to someone and then not to come through. The next time a
            promise is made, they won't believe it. People tend to build their hopes around promises,
            particularly promises about their basic livelihood.
            I've tried to adopt a philosophy as a parent never to make a promise I don't keep. I
            therefore try to make them very carefully, very sparingly, and to be aware of as many
            variables and contingencies as possible so that something doesn't suddenly come up to
            keep me from fulfilling it.
            Occasionally, despite all my effort, the unexpected does come up, creating a situation
            where it would be unwise or impossible to keep a promise I've made. But I value that
            promise. I either keep it anyway, or explain the situation thoroughly to the person
            involved and ask to be released from the promise.</p>
